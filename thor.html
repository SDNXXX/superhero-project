<p>His place here is down to JMS' run on the Thor series. JMS gave me a new look at Thor's character, namely giving him epic fantasy, engrossing adventures whilst also humanising the God of Thunder. This lead me to read more into the world of Thor. His place in mythology interested me further as I have always had a soft spot for ancient myths and legends. Thor's nobility, honour and humility make for excellent characteristics for the stoic hero he is. Thor serves as the link between the ancient mythologies throughout human history that created supernatural beings to worship and current comic book superheroes that have become the new modern day myths. This is what makes Thor an engrossing character in a literal god serving as a hero and protector of mankind.</p>
