<p>My all time favourite superhero, comic book and fictional character. He became my favourite through a mixture of the Disney Hercules film, the Superman cartoons and the Black Lace song Superman. Being British, Superman isn't an American icon to me. Instead he represents the best attributes of humanity and the ultimate force for good imaginable. Superman represents us at our absolute best. He's an ideal of humanity's values and morals but he is relatable enough to still be considered a meaningful character, not a distant icon. The irony behind Superman for me is that despite being an alien with godlike powers, he acts as human as the rest of us due to his upbringing from The Kents. His selflessness, compassion and the desire to always do the right thing are traits we could learn from and aspire to. Superman's been used in my upbringing as a moral authority and remains to me the superhero archetype by which all other heroes are measured. I'm almost certain there'll never be a comic book or fictional character I'll love more than Superman. He is simply the greatest fictional character to me.</p>
